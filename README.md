## Fashion Mnist Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify fashion pieces using the Fashion MNIST dataset and also provide real time prediction using a live webcam.

## Overview
The Fashion MNIST dataset comprises of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items from 10 categories. Each image has a resolution of 28Ã—28 pixels. This project trains a deep learning model to achieve high accuracy in fashion item classification and demonstrates its usage for predicting new clothing images using a live webcam

## Technologies Used
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
  
## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is directly loaded using keras.datasets.fashion_mnist. It is pre-split into training and testing datasets:
Training Set: 60,000 images
Testing Set: 10,000 images

## Classes
Fashion MNIST includes the following 10 categories:
T-shirt/top
Trouser
Pullover
Dress
Coat
Sandal
Shirt
Sneaker
Bag
Ankle boot
